  There is a common policy to keep a log of all USB events in our company. We also have a list of all authorized USB devices present. One of the computers got a file stolen while the employee wasn't looking, can you identify the USB device that was used? After you get it decrypt it.
  Flag is not in format, so you have to input what you get into dctf{input_here}.
