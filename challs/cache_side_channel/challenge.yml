description: |
  Your friend recently got into theoretic cryptography and has been going on and
  on about security games and proofs. They even rolled their own crypto and
  thought they were smart by using libsodium as a foundation. Now, they are
  taunting you, claiming their cipher is secure against key recovery attacks:
  "You see, I managed to rigorously prove ..." blah, blah, blah.

  You really ought to remind this person that at the end of the day, they live
  in the real world and their crypto on real silicon.
